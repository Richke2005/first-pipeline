# ETL Pipeline Project
Overview
This project showcases the creation of a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that effectively manages data processing and integration. Utilizing fundamental ETL concepts, this pipeline efficiently extracts data from various sources, transforms it into a usable format, and loads it into a target database.

Key Features
Data Extraction:
Seamless integration with multiple data sources (e.g., APIs, databases, CSV files).
Data Transformation:
Implementation of data cleaning, aggregation, and enrichment processes.
Data Loading:
Efficient loading of transformed data into a target database.
Scalability:
Designed to handle increasing data volumes with ease.
